        "* `group` - The current group assignment of the agent.\n",
        "* `gameCount` - The number of games played by the agent.\n",

        "The game can be played by calling the `getPayoff()` method with the opponent as the required parameter. This is called for each of the two agents chosen in a single game as each agent assumes the role of opponent to the other. Representing each group as an integer allows for very simple calculation of payoffs, with a lookup table implemented for each agent as follows: `[[4,0,4,0],[6,4,6,1],[4,0,1,0],[6,1,6,0]]`. This lookup table stores the payoffs for each group interaction with each group, for a total of 16 different possible interactions. \n",

        "The evolutionary aspect of the player class is called with `evaluate()`, with the required parameters of the current game opponent along with an instance of the neural network class. This method loads the agent weights into the neural network, calculates the group that the agent should be assigned to (this is the agent deciding if it should move group) and then the agent fitness is assigned as the agent wealth divided by the game count. This fitness was chosen to allow for a fair comparison between agents regardless of how many games they were randomly chosen to play.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `reset()` method is called to setup an agent ready for a new generation. This resets the group to the agents starting group, along with setting the agent wealth, fitness, and game counter to 0."

        "### Evolutionary training method\n",
        "To evolve each agents neural network weightings, the python module `DEAP` has been used. `DEAP` allows for easy crossover, mutation and selection of the population:\n",
        "* Crossover - Defined as `mate` within the `DEAP` toolbox, implemented using the `cxOnePoint` method. Probability of crossover for each individual is defined by constant `CXPB` set to `0.1`.\n",
        "* Mutation - Defined as `mutate` within the `DEAP` toolbox, implemented using the `mutGaussian` method with the parameters `mu=0.0, sigma=0.5, indpb=INDPB`. Probability of an individual being subject to mutation is defined by constant `MUTPB` set to `0.5`, and probability of each chromosome within a selected individual (neural network weight in this implementation) being mutated is defined by constant `INDPB` set to `0.1`. \n",
        "* Selection - Defined as `select` within the `DEAP` toolbox, implemented using the `selTournament` method with a tournament size of 3.\n",
        "* Generations - Number of generations is defined by constant `NGEN` set to `50`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once these toolbox commands are setup, a population of constant size `POP` (set to 500) is generated using `DEAP` where an individual in that population is an instance of the previously discussed `player` class. An instance of the neural network is also initialized to be used by the agents in the population. The game is then played with this initial population and fitness information is output. Generational evolution then begins.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each generation, tournament selection is used to select a new population of agents based on the fitness of the previous generation. This new population is then subject to crossover and mutation for each agents neural network weights. During mutation an individual also has a chance to mutate its starting group to another randomly selected group. This has the same probability of being mutated as each weight in an agent does. All agents in the population are then reset to their starting values (wealth, group, fitness and number of games played), the game then is played with this new population and fitness information for this new population is output. The next generation then begins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this method, a population uses multi-agent evolution to evolve as each game pits agents against each other. The data passed to the next generation of agents consists of the neural network weights of an agent along with the initial group assignment of the agent. This generational evolution code output can be seen in the output of this cell, showing for each generation the average and max fitness of the population, along with the group distribution of the population after all games are played."

        "Through the statistical comparisions carried out in this notebook, the multi-agent evolutionary adaptation method created for this problem produces a population that is statistically significant from the original population. The population consistently trends to all agents in the population joining the `Buddies` society which makes logical sense as the strategy of `Buddies` allows for maximum wealth gain when playing within the group, while also being defensive of any outside groups that may decide to be selfish.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fitness trend of average agent fitness converging to 4 is the best possible performance, as in a multi-agent evolutionary system, all agents should strive to the highest score possible. The best choice to benefit all agents is the choice with the highest total payoff, and the `4,4` both opponents cooperate strategy is the best total payoff for the population, so an average fitness converging to 4 shows that the ideal strategy is consistently found by the evolutionary algorithm.
